# Utility library for Commodore C-64 and POSIX/Linux

This my a small (and slowly growing) library to write programs that
should run on both Linux as well as the venerable C-64.

It also supports compilation as C++.

Currently these compilers are supported:

* [cc65](https://cc65.github.io/doc/) (for C-64)
* GCC
* CLang
